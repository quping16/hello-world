# hello-world
Welcome to my github site.

My name is Pingping Qu. Some people call me Pingping and others call me Ping. I like both-:)

I am a statistician with over 10 years of experience in data analysis. I love implementing and developing statistical/machine learning algorithms to identify associations and patterns in complex datasets. Although most of my experience is in analyzing high-dimensional genomic and clinical data, I am interested in finding patterns in any datasets. If you are interested in doing collaboration with me or need help on analyzing your data, please drop me a line at quping@yahoo.com.

My specialities -

Machine Learning / Data Mining: linear and non-linear modeling, clustering, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, SVM, neural networks 
Survival Analysis: Kaplan-Meier estimates, (ordered) logrank test, Cox regression, survival trees, cumulative incidence
Genomic Data Analysis: visualization, subgroup discovery, derivation of prognostic/predictive markers, batch effect correction
